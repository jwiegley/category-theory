(* Wikipedia: "In mathematics, the free category or path category generated by
   a directed graph or quiver is the category that results from freely
   concatenating arrows together, whenever the target of one arrow is the
   source of the next."
   
   "More precisely, the objects of the category are the vertices of the
   quiver, and the morphisms are paths between objects. Here, a path is
   defined as a finite sequence " *)
