(* Wikipedia: "If the domains of S, T are equal, then the diagram which
   defines morphisms in S↓T with α=β, α′=β′, g=h is identical to the diagram
   which defines a natural transformation S ⟹ T. The difference between the
   two notions is that a natural transformation is a particular collection of
   morphisms of type of the form S(α) → T(α), while objects of the comma
   category contains all morphisms of type of such form. A functor to the
   comma category selects that particular collection of morphisms. This is
   described succinctly by an observation by Huq that a natural transformation
   η : S → T, with S, T : A → C, corresponds to a functor A → (S↓T) which maps
   each object α to (α, α, η α) and maps each morphism g to (g, g). This is a
   bijective correspondence between natural transformations S ⟹ T and functors
   A ⟶ (S↓T) which are sections of both forgetful functors from S↓T."

   This is also given in Mac Lane, page 47, exercise 4. *)
