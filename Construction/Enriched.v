(* The objects of a category are all of some `Type`.

  Morphisms, or arrows, are also of type `Type`, but always in a universe
  above objects. All of the library has `Universe Polymorphism` enabled,
  allowing categories whose objects are categories, etc.

  The morphisms identified by `A ~> B` form a hom-set, except that in this
  library it is a hom-setoid, requiring the meaning of (computationally
  relevant) equivalence between morphisms to be given. This makes it a
  quotient category C/R over the equivalence relation R, but since this is
  almost always needed (since equality is very restrictive in Coq's type
  theory), we call it a [Category] here, and assume the existence of some
  other category using only equality, with a functor from that category to
  this.

  Note that the reason we do not split this into a more fundamental Category,
  and then define a subclass QuotientCategory from it, is that Coq's type
  theory does not allow us to define the underlying category of certain
  quotient categories (for example, that of propositional relations) without
  invoking the axioms of extensionality and/or proof irrelevance.

  Categories (as distinct from Category/~) are identified by [homset :=
  Morphism_equality]. *)
