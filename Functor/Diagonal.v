(* Wikipedia: "In category theory, a branch of mathematics, the diagonal
   functor C → C × C is given by Δ(a) = ⟨a, a⟩, which maps objects as well as
   morphisms. This functor can be employed to give a succinct alternate
   description of the product of objects within the category C: a product a ×
   b is a universal arrow from Δ to ⟨a, b⟩. The arrow comprises the projection
   maps."

  "More generally, in any functor category Cᴶ (here J should be thought of as
  a small index category), for each object a in C, there is a constant functor
  with fixed object a : Δ(a) ∈ Cᴶ. The diagonal functor Δ : C → Cᴶ assigns to
  each object of C the functor Δ(a), and to each morphism f : a → b in C the
  obvious natural transformation η in Cᴶ (given by ηⱼ = f). In the case that J
  is a discrete category with two objects, the diagonal functor C → C × C is
  recovered." *)

Theorem Diagonal_Product_Two (C : Category) :

                                Diagonal Two_Discrete x TwoDY)) *
  (∀ x y (f : x ~> y),
     fmap[Diagonal_Product C] f
       ≈ (transform[fmap[Diagonal Two_Discrete] f] TwoDX,
          transform[fmap[Diagonal Two_Discrete] f] TwoDY)).
