(* Any pre-ordered set forms a category. See also [Ord], for the category of
   pre-ordered sets (where the sets are the objects, and morphisms are
   monotonic mappings.

   Wikipedia: "A category with at most one morphism from any object X to any
   other object Y is a preorder. Such categories are called thin. In this
   sense, categories 'generalize' preorders by allowing more than one relation
   between objects: each morphism is a distinct (named) preorder relation." *)
