(* mathoverflow: "You will have to make an arbitrary choice for the direction
   of morphisms: is the left adjoint "forward" or "backward"? To prevent that,
   you can add involutions. The resulting category [InvAdj] of involutive
   categories and adjunctions has a lot of interesting structure. It is a
   dagger category, and in fact the `mother of all dagger categories', as it
   universally embeds any dagger category. In particular, the full subcategory
   of (ortho)posets and Galois connections has dagger kernels, dagger
   biproducts, an an opclassifier. See these two papers. Now for the
   definition (from 3.1.8 of my thesis):

   A functor ∗ : C^op → C is called involutive when ∗ ∘ ∗ = Id. Define a
   category [InvAdj] as follows. Objects are pairs (C,∗) of a category with an
   involution. A morphism (C,∗) → (D,∗) is functor F : C^op → D that has a
   left adjoint, where two such functors are identified when they are
   naturally isomorphic. The identity morphism on (C,∗) is the functor ∗ :
   C^op → C ; its left adjoint is ∗^op : C → C^op. The composition of F : C^op
   → D and G : D^op → E is defined by G ∘ ∗^op ∘ F : C^op → E; its left
   adjoint is F′ ∘ ∗ ∘ G′, where F′ ⊣ F and G′ ⊣ G.

   (It is not arbitrary to require a left adjoint instead of a right one. A
   contravariant functor from C to D can be written both as a (covariant)
   functor F : C^op → D or as a (covariant) functor F^op : C → D^op. The
   latter version has a right adjoint precisely when the former version has a
   left adjoint.)" *)
